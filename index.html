	 <img src="maxloadout.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 200px"> </img>
	 
	 
	 <p>
	 	One can get maxedout in less than 4months by <i>coinfarming</i>, playing multiplayer and events. coinfarming will generate more coins, events will return valuable cards and multiplayer will return some few rewards.
	 	</p>
	 	
	 	<!second list item>
	 	
<li> <p= style "text-align: left"> <u><h4>What is coinfarming and how to do it ?</h4></u></p></li>

<p>
	Coinfarming is the process of getting coins faster in the game. It is done by using rocket launchers (advisably two) and going to the first mission of new ceres jungle and kill the enemies from the heliport. By doing this, you will obtain RPG kill (+50 coins ) for each successful shot.The image below explains better.

For coin farming to be successful, its advisable to use boom and ignition as boom has the largest magazine size followed by ignition.Also, its advisable that boom should be upgraded to at least 220 and ignition 170.All these are from experience.

<!third list item>

<li> <p style= "text-align: left"><u><h4>What gear combination to use?</h4></u></p> 
</li>
<p>
	If you want to get maxedout ontime your are advised to use gears from epic cards. The easiest combination is saggititarius and juggernaut.Also, you must know that the snipers are the most powerful weapons. If you want to be faster while you move in the game you are advised to use cheetah or nightcore.However cheetah is easier to max out just like juggernaut. However, the most powerful and reliable combination is Arachnid and Titan or Nightcore.

<!fourth list item>

<li> <p style="text-align: left">
	<u><h4>Events are so tough!</h4></u></p></li>
	<p>
		Events are meant to be tough but as a noob, the pros wont let you see the light to make things better, you are advised to start events last six hours or last four hours or even 1day 1hour There was a time i started rush elite last 30 mins and i got ten packs.
	</p>

<!fifth list item>

<li><p style="text-align:left"><u><h4>What avatar to use ?</h4></u></p>
</li>
  <p>
Its ok to use any avatar but some avatar have specs eg prometheus spec is invisibility usually in alien city. Ludo's spec is that sometimes his head is hard to get.One more thing there is the coins obtainable from the excess cards after unlocking an avatar which makes the need to unlock all avatars.

  	<!sixth list item>
  <li><p style="text-align: left"><u><h4>How to camp</u></h4></p>
  	</li>
  	<p>
  		Campimg requires skill and experience but as a beginner i advise you to find a favourite spot usually close to a spawn point and practice with it.you can have many favourite spots.you can as well deal with campers by attacking from their blind spots or using katana even rpg.
  	</p>
  	<! seventh list item>
  	<li>
  		<p style ="text-align:left"><u><h4>How to gain ratings</h4></u></p>
  	</li>
  	<p>
  		Ratings can be gained when you take first position in a match with the most kills and the least deaths especially against players with good amount of ratings.
